## **What I Do**

- Design and manage reproducable bioinformatics pipelines on high-performance computing clusters.
- Develop and host portable shiny dashboards for genomic data digestion.
- Consult on experimental design to optimize effect size and select suitable statistical analysis. 

I am a freelance bioinformatics / data analysis consultant. If you or someone you know has a Big Job<sup>TM</sup>, contact me at [dbinfo](dylan@dbinfo.dev) and I will happily design a custom solution for you. Whether you are a PI with no time for untangling software dependencies and HPC optimizations, or you're a big-picture business owner who needs their data swamp streamlined and AWS cluster maintained, dbinfo LLC is the consultant for you.
