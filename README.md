## **What I Do**

- Design reproducible bioinformatics pipelines on high-performance computing clusters.
- Develop and host portable shiny dashboards for genomic data digestion.
- Consult on experimental design to optimize effect size and select suitable statistical analyses. 

I am a freelance bioinformatics / data analysis consultant. I provide a service that includes the full-stack of a pipeline; from quality controlling raw-data to reproducible containerized analysis to scaling Big Data<sup>TM</sup> on an HPC to statistical interpretation and interactive visualization, I steward your data every step of the way to ensure consistency and interpretability of the final output. Contact me at [dbinfo LLC](dylan@dbinfo.dev) and I will happily design a custom solution for you.
